# SSOT core instructions (AI)

Follow `docs/policy/03-core-guidelines.md` for all edits.

Hard rules:
- Do not delete or omit existing sections unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer minimal diffs; do not rewrite files unnecessarily.
- Run/obey formatters + linters first; then fix issues.
- Do not introduce secrets or credentials into the repo.
- Quote variables by default in shell scripts.
- Keep scripts idempotent and deterministic.
