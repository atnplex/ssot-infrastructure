# Repo inventory (raw, sanitized)

## Rules (hard)
- Never commit API tokens / PATs / auth headers. (Your earlier paste contained a GitHub PAT.) 
- Never commit private keys or cert private keys (`*.key`, `*.pem`). 
- Paste *sanitized* repo lists only (repo names, URLs, notes are OK).

## Paste areas

### atnplex/*
PASTE HERE (repo names + URLs, no tokens)

### anguy079/*
PASTE HERE (repo names + URLs, no tokens)
