# AI canon intake (sanitize first)

Paste sanitized versions of:
- Prompts
- Architecture standards
- Formatting/output rules (e.g., quadruple-backtick outer fence rules)
- Script templates

Then we will normalize into:
- docs/policy/
- templates/scripts/
- .github/instructions/ and .github/prompts/
